# What is Kafka and why it is used?
Kafka is primarily used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that 
adapt to the data streams. It combines messaging, storage, and stream processing to allow 
storage and analysis of both historical and real-time data.

# Is Kafka a database?
Apache Kafka is a database. It provides ACID guarantees and is used in hundreds of companies 
for mission-critical deployments. However, in many cases, Kafka is not competitive to other databases.

# What problems does Kafka solve?
Kafka's origin story at LinkedIn
The problem they originally set out to solve was low-latency ingestion of large amounts of 
event data from the LinkedIn website and infrastructure into a lambda architecture that harnessed 
Hadoop and real-time event processing systems. The key was the "real-time" processing.
